# Welcome to ChemFate!
## Chemical Fate and Transport models
A level IV dynamic chemical fate and transport tool that can handle four classes of chemicals
  1) organoFate - non-ionizable organic chemicals
  2) ionOFate - ionizable organic chemicals
  3) metalFate - metals
  4) nanoFate - nanomaterials

To run ChemFate: 

1. Please keep the input files in the 'Input' folder.
	- ChemParam_nonionizableOrganic.xlsx
  - ChemParam_ionizableOrganic.xlsx
  - ChemParam_metal.xlsx
  - ChemParam_nanomaterial.xlsx
  - ChemRelease.xlsx
  - Region.xlsx

2. Please don't change the names of files in 'Input' Folder.
	- if you want to change to another chemical or another region,
	you can just replace the content inside those files.

3. If you are going to run ChemFate for 10 yrs of data (2005 1 1 to 2014 12 31),
	it would take around 3-5 mins.

If you have any questions, please contact Dr. Arturo Keller (arturokeller@ucsb.edu), Keller Lab, Bren School, UC Santa Barbara, USA
