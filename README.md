# Welcome to ChemFate!
## Chemical Fate and Transport models
A level IV dynamic chemical fate and transport tool that can handle four classes of chemicals
  1) organoFate - non-ionizable organic chemicals
  2) ionOFate - ionizable organic chemicals
  3) metalFate - metals
  4) nanoFate - nanomaterials

* ChemFate has been published in Chemosphere, please go to for detailed model documentation. [here] (https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126897)

To run ChemFate through a simple GUI (ChemFate.exe), 
here is the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cw0ZS8vbOqD6Q8-T9F63-3EsKLPbyLYu/view?usp=sharing

1. Please keep the input files in the 'Input' folder.
	- ChemParam_nonionizableOrganic.xlsx
	- ChemParam_ionizableOrganic.xlsx
	- ChemParam_metal.xlsx
	- ChemParam_nanomaterial.xlsx
	- ChemRelease.xlsx
	- Region.xlsx

2. Please don't change the names of files in the 'Input' Folder.
	- if you want to change to another chemical or another region,
	you can just replace the content inside those files.

3. Your model results will be in the 'Output' Folder.

4. If you are going to run ChemFate for 10 yrs of data (2005 1 1 to 2014 12 31),
	it may take around 3-5 mins.

If you have any questions, please contact Dr. Arturo A. Keller (arturokeller@ucsb.edu), Keller Lab, Bren School, UC Santa Barbara, USA
